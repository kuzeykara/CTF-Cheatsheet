# CTF-Cheatsheet

A collection of notes, cheatsheets, and templates for CTFs. I use it to:

- Organize and understand cybersecurity concepts.
- Keep quick references for tools and techniques.

## Structure

- **Concepts**: Notes on cybersecurity topics.
- **Cheatsheets**: Guides for tools and techniques.
